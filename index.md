The [Landback Universities project](landbackuniversities.org) is pleased to announce five public discussions. Centering the principles of LANDBACK, a movement that locates liberation for Indigenous people and people of color in “putting Indigenous Lands back into Indigenous hands,” Landback Universities seeks to collaboratively develop a vision of higher education rooted in collective stewardship of the lands on which colleges and universities sit through humanistic inquiry. 

Recognizing that there are myriad ways that colonialism operates through our institutions, Landback Universities focus on humanities-based approaches to land relations because rematriation of land lies at the heart of decolonization. In this context, Landback Universities has three objectives: 1) explore how to facilitate conversations between faculty, administrators, staff, and students to develop strategies for meaningfully decolonizing university operations; 2) develop and disseminate recommendations that colleges and universities can implement to return stewardship of university lands to Native nations they have dispossessed; 3) serve as a proof-of-concept for using these methods to identify strategies that promote Indigenous sovereignty throughout the diverse range of offices, operations, and units that comprise universities. 

Our five public discussions will feature a brief case study presentation on Landback practices at a US university followed by an open discussion of strategies being used to meaningfully decolonize university campuses and their operations.  Events are free to attend, but advanced registration for the event is required. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting. You are welcome to register for multiple discussions.
